### BIO:

Husband, Father, Community Geek.  
I am a leader of the Denver VMware User Group [@DenverVMUG](https://twitter.com/DenverVMUG) and Denver PowerShell User Group [@DenverPSUG](https://twitter.com/DenverPSUG), and a member of the [@vBrownBag](https://twitter.com/vbrownbag) crew.  
I'm also a Microsoft MVP, VMware vExprt & vExpert PRO, Veeam Vanguard, Cisco Champion, and Tanzu Vanguard.
Currently I'm also a Senior Solutions Architect for Pure Storage, working on FlashStack, and focused on automating all the things.  
I spend most of my time working within the lab, when not being active in planning or hosting community events.
